GLIF XML SCHEMA DEFINITION

This is an XML Schema for the Glyph Interchange Format, an XML representation of a single glyph in the Unified Font Object's font data storage. Read more at http://unifiedfontobject.org/.


SCHEMA'S ARCHITECTURE

The shape of this schema is determined by separation of documented datatypes and a bare element structure. This makes documentation readable and the structure clear. The schema is thus divided into following sections:

1. Documented definitions of
   A. custom simple types
   B. complex types as childless entities, defined flat-wise, with their attributes only.

2. Structure of elements as content extensions of the complex types defined earlier.
