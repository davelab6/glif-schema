This element is a place to store authoring tool specific, user specific or otherwise arbitrary data for the glyph. lib mus have one child element that is structure as a dictionary formatted as an XML Property List. This element may occur at most once. In order to prevent conflicts in the lib, keys in the top level should follow a reverse domain naming scheme. The pattern "public.*", where * represents an arbitrary string of one or more characters, is reserved for use in standardized lib keys. It is recommended that the data stored as a value be as shallow as possible.</xs:documentation>
