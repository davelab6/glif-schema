GLIF XML SCHEMA DEFINITION

This is an XML Schema for the Glyph Interchange Format, an XML representation of a single glyph in the Unified Font Object's font data storage. Read more at http://unifiedfontobject.org/.


SCHEMA'S ARCHITECTURE

Elements of both GLIF 1 & 2 Schemas are defined as independent, linked modules that are reused whenever possible. Modules of the GLIF 2 Schema that supersede the earlier format either include the old elements as is, or extend them if necessary.


THE LINT SCRIPT

You can validate against the schema GLIF files in batches of whole UFO packages by running the lint shell script with paths to the packages as arguments.
