GLIF XML SCHEMA DEFINITION

This is an XML Schema for the Glyph Interchange Format, an XML representation of a single glyph in the Unified Font Object's font data storage. Read more at http://unifiedfontobject.org/.


SCHEMA'S ARCHITECTURE

Elements of both GLIF 1 & 2 Schemas are defined as independent, linked modules that are reused whenever possible. There's one restriction, though, that the extensions required by elements that have changed with the second version takes place inside the root element of the GLIF 2 Schema.
